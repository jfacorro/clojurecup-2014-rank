The idea is that you can add this to your Clojure/Clojurescript code base and then answer questions straight from IRC. One could also send other notifications. For example: when a user gets a 404 this could show up in the chat, and you can start comforting them straight away.\n\nIt's extremely rough around the edges, and right now it's showing all IRC traffic, rather than just a subset (say, when the user in question gets highighlighted). In fact, it's showing a superset of IRC traffic - it looked so empty with just #clojurecup-breakfast that I added the #clojure channel too (you can however not reply to that channel).\n\nCSFR is missing.
